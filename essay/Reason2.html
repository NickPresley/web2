    <p class="wa">18-25-year-olds have lower voting turnouts. In the article “Lowering the Voting Age”, they mention “According to the United States Elections Project’s analysis of US Census Bureau data, just 16% of eligible voters ages 18-29 voted in the 2014 election, compared to 30% for ages 30-44, 43% for 45-59, and 55% for age 60 and up. Over the last 30 years, voter turnout for 18-29-year-olds has never exceeded 21% in a midterm election.” This means that 18-29-year-olds usually don’t vote for the better candidate.</p>
