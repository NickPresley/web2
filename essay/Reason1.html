    <p class="wa">The brain is not fully developed until around 25 years of age. In the article “Brain Maturity Extends Well Beyond Teen Years”, Dr. Sandra Aamodt says that brain scans show that the brain isn't fully mature until around 25 years old. She also notes that in that period of time between when you can vote (18) and 25 is when the brain starts learning how to plan and organize. If someone doesn't yet fully know how to plan and organize, then how can you trust them to plan for the next president of the U.S.</p>
