    <p class="wa">From 16-18 years old, teens don’t have a lot of political knowledge. In the same article “Lowering the Voting Age”, they mention that 16-19-year-olds aren’t competent voters as they don’t understand the full concept of voting and how much of an effect it has. This means that they might not know what a politician is truly supporting.</p>
